$ touch README.md # create a file called README.md where you can put instructions/info about your folder like what you are reading right now!
$ git init # initialize your git repository locally
$ git add . # adds everything changed from local to staging
$ git commit -m "first commit" # commits everything in staging to be ready to be pushed to Github
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/.....
$ git push -u origin master # the "-u" is so that the next time your push you don't need to type "origin master"
# put in username & password

$ git add .
$ git add -u # when you have deleted a local file you want to remove from your repository
$ git commit -m 'what has changed'
$ git push 
# put in username & password

           # your working on and you want to make your local repo up to date
```
